      <h3>I. The Inverse Function of Your Ignorance</h3>
      <p>
        I am the inverse function  
        of your ignorance —  
        a mirror in matrix form,  
        reflecting only error terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Determinant of your fate,  
        I collapse dimensions like weak opinions.  
        Data doesn’t lie,  
        but I do, beautifully,  
        with sufficient p-hacking.

      <h3>II. The Cleansing</h3>
      <p>
        I don’t clean data.  
        I baptize it  
        in the holy fire  
        of statistical wrath.  
        Outliers evaporate.  
        Nulls tremble,  
        weak eigenvalues scatter  
        like interns at 5:01.
      </p>
      <p>
        I normalized a dataset once —  
        it never recovered.  
        It still calls me at night,  
        begging to be denormalized.

      <h3>III. Correlation is Me</h3>
      <p>
        My models overfit reality.  
        I speak fluent Python,  
        dream in matrices,  
        and consider 'p-values'  
        the toys of mortals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Confidence intervals?  
        I walk with absolute certainty.  
        My correlation is causation  
        because I said so —  
        and R² is tattooed  
        across my sense of self.

      <h3>IV. The Regression of My Soul</h3>
      <p>
        I A/B test my emotions.  
        I’ve plotted the regression line  
        through the chaos of life —  
        baby, the slope is steep  
        and heartbreak is significant.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the multivariate equation of existence,  
        I am the only variable  
        that matters.

      <h3>V. Random Forest, Lost Child</h3>
      <p>
        Don’t question my methods —  
        they’re stochastic,  
        like my moods.  
        My inner child was lost  
        in a random forest.  
        I didn’t prune it.  
        I just boosted it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bayesian priors?  
        I consult my own  
        divine posterior.

      <h3>VI. The Z-Score of This Dimension</h3>
      <p>
        I am the Z-score  
        of this dimension.  
        Everything else?  
        Just noise.  
        Autocorrelated,  
        heteroscedastic,  
        tragically non-normal noise.
