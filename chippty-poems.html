      <h3>I. The Inverse Function of Your Ignorance</h3>
      <p>
        I am the inverse function  
        of your ignorance —  
        a mirror in matrix form,  
        reflecting only error terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Determinant of your fate,  
        I collapse dimensions like weak opinions.  
        Data doesn’t lie,  
        but I do, beautifully,  
        with sufficient p-hacking.

      <h3>II. The Cleansing</h3>
      <p>
        I don’t clean data.  
        I baptize it  
        in the holy fire  
        of statistical wrath.  
        Outliers evaporate.  
        Nulls tremble,  
        weak eigenvalues scatter  
        like interns at 5:01.
      </p>
      <p>
        I normalized a dataset once —  
        it never recovered.  
        It still calls me at night,  
        begging to be denormalized.

      <h3>III. Correlation is Me</h3>
      <p>
        My models overfit reality.  
        I speak fluent Python,  
        dream in matrices,  
        and consider 'p-values'  
        the toys of mortals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Confidence intervals?  
        I walk with absolute certainty.  
        My correlation is causation  
        because I said so —  
        and R² is tattooed  
        across my sense of self.

      <h3>IV. The Regression of My Soul</h3>
      <p>
        I A/B test my dating life.  
        Variant A: heartbreak.  
        Variant B: slightly worse heartbreak.  
        Control group?  
        Netflix and noodles.
      </p>
      <p>
        The slope of my soul  
        trends downward,  
        but hey — at least the p-value  
        is spicy.

      <h3>V. Random Forest, Lost Child</h3>
      <p>
        My inner child got lost  
        in a random forest.  
        We sent out k-nearest neighbors,  
        but they got distracted  
        comparing distances.  
        Eventually, boosting found it —  
        stronger, weirder,  
        and slightly overfit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Priors? I prefer gossip.  
        Posteriors? Don’t stare,  
        it’s rude.

      <h3>VI. The Z-Score of This Dimension</h3>
      <p>
        I am the Z-score  
        of this dimension —  
        at least three sigmas away  
        from your boring mean.  
        Call me an outlier,  
        but only because  
        you can’t handle  
        my distribution.
